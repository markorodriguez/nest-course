When we use NEST.JS we usually separate our logic into controllers and services

Controllers: are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.
Services: are responsible for handling business logic. 
Injectable: is a decorator that marks a class as available to be injected and then inject it into other classes that require it.

Dependency Injection: An injection is the passing of a dependency (an instance) to a dependent object (a client) that would use it.

Prisma just needs one place to declare the Models
